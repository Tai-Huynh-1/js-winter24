console.log("Hello World!");

// JS: Dynamically typed language / Java/ TypeScript: Statically typed language

myFirstVariable = 5; // reassigned to a number

// Compile: JS: Interpreted Language (runtime) => Translate the code line by line before execution => CPU => Slower runtime / likely faster dev time (garbage collector / auto. memory management)

// Compile: Java: Compiled Language (compile time) => Java Bytecode (JVM) (runtime) => Assembly Language => Binary Code => CPU => Faster than inter. language, but slower than C/C++ (garbage collector / auto. memory management)

// Compile: C/C++: Compiled Language (compile time) => Assembly Language => Binary Code => CPU => Extremely fast runtime / likely slower dev time / manual memory management

// Memory: Disk/SSD (persistent) (bigger/slower) => RAM (non-persistent) (smaller than disk/faster) => CPU (register memory) (non-persistent)
